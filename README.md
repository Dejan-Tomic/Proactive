# ProActive Stopwatch

# About
A timer tailor made for boxing bag work that can set the number of rounds and round duration but can be used for any interval training activity.

# Features
- Create a timer duration from 1 second to 60 minutes in 1 second intervals
- The display shows time left and the rest round you are currently on

# Features to add
- Select the number of rounds
- Support for other iOS compatible devices
- Audio feedback that tells the user when landmarks have been reached (e.g. halfway through the round) and signifies the end of the round

#  Compatibility
This project is written in Swift 5.0 and Xcode 11.4. It has been tested and works on an iPhone 8 running ios 13.0. It will work on other devices but the layout has not been optimized for them yet. 

# Bugs Found
06.07.20 - When the user presses the stop button time speeds up instead of stopping the timer
